## Getting the Data

### By Browsing

You can browse the list of available files and download them individually at:

[http://project.knowledgeforge.net/ukparse/svn/trunk/parldata/scrapedxml/](http://project.knowledgeforge.net/ukparse/svn/trunk/parldata/scrapedxml/)

### By SVN

**Warning: There is a *lot* of data, downloading it all may take a while.**

You can check out a copy of all the latest Hansard XML via SVN using:

`svn co http://project.knowledgeforge.net/ukparse/svn/trunk/parldata/scrapedxml`

### By rsync

**Warning: There is a *lot* of data, downloading it all may take a while.**

The easiest way to get hold of all the data currently stored for Hansard is
via rsync to `data.theyworkforyou.com::parldata`. You can see what's available
by running:

`rsync data.theyworkforyou.com::parldata`

You can then use rsync to retrieve content as necessary. Check `man rsync` for
more information on the available options.

We strongly recommend that where possible you use `--exclude '.svn' --exclude
'tmp/'` switches, as these are used for processing and versioning, and aren't
relevant to the data. A command to download the complete dataset is:

`rsync -az --progress --exclude '.svn' --exclude 'tmp/' data.theyworkforyou.com::parldata .`

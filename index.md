###### What can I find here?

Structured versions of publicly available data from the UK parliament, and the
source code that was used to generate the data. This is the engine of clever
stuff which runs <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com">TheyWorkForYou.com</a>
and <a href="http://www.publicwhip.org.uk">The Public Whip</a>. You might find
the <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/api">TheyWorkForYou API</a> easier to
use.

###### Who can I talk to about it?

Contact the TheyWorkForYou team at <a
href="mailto:team&#64;theyworkforyou.com">team&#64;theyworkforyou.com</a> with
any questions, or join the <a

## Types of Data

ParlParse holds a large amount of data about the UK Parliament, in the following
broad categories:

* [Members](members.html)  
  Files which describe the current and past members of both the House of Commons
  and the House of Lords, their affiliations, government and opposition positions,
  constituencies, claimed expenses and where to find additional information.

* [Hansard Reports](hansard.html)  
  Files which describe the current and past members of both the House of Commons
  and the House of Lords, their affiliations, government and opposition positions,
  constituencies, claimed expenses and where to find additional information.

## Tools &amp; Code

* [Parser](parser.html)  
  The collection of scripts which actually gathers the information and turns it
  into structured data.
